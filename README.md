# SHIELD-INSURANCE
This project tells the story of Shield Insurance through data—exploring customer behavior, sales channels, and city-wise performance using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## 🛡️ Shield Insurance Analysis – A Data Story
### 📌 Project Background

During my virtual internship at AtliQ Technologies, I was given a real-world business problem to solve using data.
The task was not just to build a dashboard, but to understand the business, analyze the data, and tell a story through insights.

This project focuses on Shield Insurance and how their data can be used to support better decision-making.

### 🏢 Understanding the Business

Shield Insurance operates across major Indian cities such as Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad, and Indore.
They offer flexible and affordable insurance policies and reach customers through both offline and online sales channels.

With data coming from multiple cities, age groups, and sales modes, the company wanted a clearer picture of what is working well and where improvements are needed.

### ❓ The Business Challenge

Shield Insurance knew they had valuable data, but it wasn’t being fully used.
They wanted to answer questions like:

- Which sales channels perform best?

- Which customer age groups generate the most revenue?

- Which cities are driving growth, and which are lagging behind?

To start this journey, they requested a pilot Power BI dashboard that could convert raw data into actionable insights.

### 📊 Building the Dashboard

I designed the dashboard in Power BI, focusing on clarity and business relevance.
The dashboard is divided into three main sections:

### 🔹 General Overview

This page provides a high-level view of the business:

- Overall revenue and customer trends over time

- City-wise and age-wise performance breakdown

- A quick snapshot to understand the health of the business

### 🔹 Sales Mode Analysis

This section answers an important question: How are different sales channels performing?

- Revenue and customer contribution by each sales mode

- City-wise performance comparison across channels

- Identification of high-performing and growing sales modes

### 🔹 Age Group Analysis

Here, the focus is on customer behavior:

- Revenue, customer, and policy distribution by age group

- Identification of key and underperforming age segments

- Insights that can help in targeted marketing and product planning

### 💡 Insights That Tell a Story
### 🔹 Direct Agents Lead, Digital Is Catching Up

The analysis showed that Direct Agents generate the highest revenue, while Online channels are steadily growing.
This indicates a strong traditional sales base, with increasing customer interest in digital platforms.

✅ Recommendation: Improve the app and online experience and invest more in digital marketing to accelerate online growth.

### 🔹 Middle-Aged Customers Drive Revenue

Customers in the 31–45 age group contribute the most to total revenue, while the 17–24 age group contributes the least.
This highlights a strong core customer segment and an opportunity to build early relationships with younger customers.

✅ Recommendation:

- Create retention-focused plans for the 31–45 segment

- Run awareness campaigns and entry-level plans for the 17–24 segment using social media

### 🔹 Strong Performance in Delhi-NCR, Opportunity in Indore

Delhi-NCR has the highest number of customers, making it a key growth region.
On the other hand, Indore shows lower customer engagement, indicating untapped potential.

✅ Recommendation:

- Introduce loyalty programs in Delhi-NCR to maintain momentum

- Increase localized marketing in Indore and promote best-selling policies

### 🎯 Final Takeaway

This project helped demonstrate how data can tell a clear business story when presented effectively.
By combining business understanding with Power BI visuals, the dashboard highlights:

- What is working well

- Where improvements are needed

- How data can guide smarter business decisions
